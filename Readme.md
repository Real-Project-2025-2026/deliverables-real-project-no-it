# Concentral

Concentral is a platform that helps students find café study spaces and book food and drink bundles with guaranteed study time slots.

## About
Students often struggle to find reliable places to study in cafés, particularly during busy hours. Concentral addresses this challenge by allowing students to reserve fixed-duration study time slots bundled with prepaid food and drink options.

For cafés, Concentral helps convert unused tables during off-peak hours into predictable revenue.

## Target Users
**Students**  
Individuals seeking focused and reliable study environments.

**Cafés**  
Businesses with unused seating capacity during quieter periods.
